            <p>Anthony Edward Stark is a character portrayed by Robert Downey Jr. in 
                the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) film franchise—based on the Marvel Comics 
                character of the same name—commonly known by his alter ego, Iron Man. In the films, 
                Stark is an industrialist, genius inventor, hero and former playboy who is CEO of Stark Industries. 
                At the beginning of the series, he is a chief weapons manufacturer for the U.S. military, 
                until he has a change of heart and redirects his technical knowledge into the creation of 
                mechanized suits of armor which he uses to defend against those that would threaten peace around 
                the world.
